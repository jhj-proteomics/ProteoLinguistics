# ProteoLinguistics
Have you ever contemplated the potential of individual proteins concealing patterns or messages within their amino acid sequences? While these molecules don't carry deliberate messages, the exploration of such patterns can offer an intriguing lens into molecular biology.

With rigorous methodology and the integration of computational tools, I've developed (in collaboration with ChatGPT-4) a robust script. This script processes .fasta files, commonly sourced from databases like UniProt, by cross-referencing them against a comprehensive English dictionary. The outcomes of this analysis are systematically compiled into a .csv file, offering a structured yet fascinating perspective on coincidental linguistic patterns in protein sequences.

For users with an extensive collection of .fasta files, our script is optimized to handle batch processing of an entire directory. However, should you require a singular file analysis, some modifications to the script will be necessary.

This repository houses both the script and the wordlist. The onus of procuring the .fasta files for investigation remains with the user, adding an element of research initiative.

I invite you to delve into this confluence of linguistics and molecular biology. 

Happy analyzing!
