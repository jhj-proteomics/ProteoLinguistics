Welcome to the world of ProteoLinguistics. 

Did ever think about how individial proteins might hide hidden messages in the amino acid sequence?

No? Well, they don't. At least not intentionally. However, it's a fun game to play either by yourself for your own amusement or together with friends or fellow nerds.

For that purpose I have written (or co-written with ChatGPT-4) a short script that will take any .fasta file (from e.g. UniProt) and search it against a 
list of words from the English dictionary. The results are then saved as a .csv file for you to read and have fun with. 

Both the script and the wordlist is saved within this repository but it's up to you to find the .fasta files you want to use. That's also a fun part of this game. 

Have fun!
